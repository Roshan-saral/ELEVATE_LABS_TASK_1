TASK 1: Create a Cloud Storage Bucket and Upload Files

# ☁️ Cloud Storage Bucket & File Upload Task

This project demonstrates the basics of cloud object storage using **AWS S3** or **Google Cloud Storage** (Free Tier). It walks through creating a bucket, uploading files, and accessing them via public URLs — a foundational skill for cloud engineers and developers.

## 🎯 Objective

Understand how cloud object storage works by:

- Creating a storage bucket
- Uploading a sample file
- Accessing the file via a public URL

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (Free Tier)  
  _or_  
- [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) (Free Tier)

## 📚 Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create a Free Cloud Account**  
   - [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)  
   - [Google Cloud Free Tier](https://cloud.google.com/free)

2. **Create a Storage Bucket**  
   - Navigate to **Cloud Storage** → **Create Bucket**
   - Choose a **globally unique name** for your bucket
   - Select a region (e.g., `us-east1`)

3. **Configure Permissions**  
   - Leave default settings (private or public as needed)

4. **Upload a Sample File**  
   - Use a `.txt` or `.jpg` file for demonstration

5. **Copy the Public URL** (if public access is enabled)

6. **Test the Link in Your Browser**  
   - Confirm the file is accessible
